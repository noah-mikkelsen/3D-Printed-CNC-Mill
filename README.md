# 3D_Printed_CNC_Mill
3-axis CNC Mill designed in Fusion 360 using budget and custom 3D printed components
# Overview
This project was undertaken as a challenge to improve skills in mechanical design using CAD and mechatronics integration with Arduino and GRBL.
The mill was designed for machining metal, wood and acrylic in 3 dimensions using a 1.5kW spindle. These documents highlight its design, assembly and manufacture.
